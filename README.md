## License
Code is [*GNU General Public License*, v3](https://github.com/UnderSet/re-gm-mw2022hud/blob/main/LICENSE) due to (future) use of code from DyaMetR's [D-GL4 HUD (aka `holohud2`)](https://github.com/DyaMetR/holohud2).

Might use code from Arctic's ARC9 and ArcCW but those don't have a license literally anywhere. *Arctic please add one.*

Textures (the images) are by me and are public domain or [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) **except** for those under `\material\mwii\reference` as they're screenshots of *Modern Warfare II* and thus are copyrighted by Activision.

Font is Stratum 2, and is copyright Eric Olson.

## Credits
- *Infinity Ward* and *Activision* for [*Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II*](https://www.callofduty.com/store/games/modernwarfare2), which was the inspiration and reference for this HUD.
